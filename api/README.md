# Laravel API
[Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail) is ready with its [VS Code devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configuration, only tweaked to mount the `/` root directory so that Git can see it.

Simply open this `/api` folder in VS Code, then choose "Reopen in container" .

Alternatively, start Sail with :
```bash
# cwd=/api
./vendor/bin/sail up
```
